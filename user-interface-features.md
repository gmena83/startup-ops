This document details all the features that must be present on the user interface of the application.
Features to implement:

1. It must have a switch to toggle between light and dark mode.
2. It must have a switch to toggle between English and Spanish
3. The footer must have a link to the terms of service, data management and privacy policy.
4. The footer must contain a legend stating that "Startup Ops is a product of Menatech" and a link to <https://menatech.cloud>
5. The Section below the Hero section must show with animated cards on a carrousel the problems that Startup Ops can solve for the user with the added value of the features of the application. The idea is that the carrousel transitions between sets of 2 cards, one showing a problem related to being a founder (Can be found on D:\Menatech\Antigravity\startup-ops\startup-ops\StartupOPS_Give Founders Their Time Back.pptx.txt) and the other showing the solution provided by Startup Ops (Can be found on D:\Menatech\Antigravity\startup-ops\startup-ops\StartupOPS_ Give Founders Their Time Back.pptx.txt).
6. The website must look modern, corporate enough so it doesn't look like a social media app or something not professional, but innocative and tech enough that it doesn't look like a corporate website.
7. On the client's dashboard, when sending the final variables to begin with the automation process, interface should show an animation that states that the process is ongoing, and that the client should get an email with the report in less than 10 minutes. The animation can be a "water down" version of the automation nodes working together to process all the input, showing the logos of the APIs used, like OpenAI, Perplexity, etc.
8. Create an admin dashboard to manage users, their balance, and their automations, see how many automations are currently running, in which step they are, and have a detailed log of each one, so if any step fails I have the information to fix it.
