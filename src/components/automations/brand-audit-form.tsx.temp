// Wait, Step 20 list_dir `src/components/ui` showed: button.tsx, glass-card.tsx, input.tsx. 
// It does NOT show `card.tsx`. 
// The user said `shadcn/ui` component library. 
// I should check if `card.tsx` exists or use `glass-card.tsx`.
// `glass-card.tsx` might be the custom card.
// Let me use `glass-card.tsx` or just standard HTML if unsure, but better to check.
// Actually, `Step 20` listing of `components/ui` was remarkably short: button, glass-card, input, language-provider, theme-toggle.
// It seems `card` is missing or `glass-card` is the one.
// I will assume `glass-card` is to be used or I need to stick to what is available.
// Let's look at `glass-card.tsx` content first to see how to use it.
// FOR NOW, I will write this file assuming I might need to adjust the import.
// usage: <GlassCard> ... </GlassCard> potentially.
// I'll pause to check `glass-card` before writing this file.
// CANCEL THIS WRITE. I will use `view_file` on `glass-card.tsx` first.
