# StartupOPS: Give Founders Their Time Back

## 🚀 Mission
StartupOPS is an AI-powered platform designed to solve the "Founder's Dilemma": spending 24 hours a week on administrative tasks instead of growth and strategy. Our goal is to automate the mundane so founders can focus on what matters.

## 🌟 Core Value Proposition
* **Target Audience:** SME Founders and Solopreneurs.
* **The Problem:** Founders lose ~$114k-$1M/year in opportunity costs doing admin work.
* **The Solution:** A "Select -> Input -> Result" automation engine.

## 🛠 Features (MVP)
* **6 Core Automations:** Ready-to-use workflows described in `automations.md`.
* **Bilingual Support:** Fully operational in English and Spanish (EN/ES).
* **Mobile First:** Responsive design for founders on the go.
* **Email Delivery:** Results delivered directly to the user's inbox.
