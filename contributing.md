# Contributing to StartupOPS

We are building a tool to save time, not waste it. Code contributions should reflect this philosophy.

## 🧠 Guiding Principles
1.  **Simplicity Over Complexity:** We target non-tech founders. If a feature requires a manual, it's too complex.
2.  **Bilingual by Default:** Every UI component and error message must have an EN and ES counterpart.
3.  **Mobile First:** Most of our users are on their phones. Test responsiveness on every PR.

## 🚫 The "Don'ts"
* **Do not** expose raw API errors to the user.
* **Do not** create automations that require coding knowledge from the end-user.
* **Do not** break the "3-Step Flow" (Select -> Input -> Result).

## 📝 Pull Request Process
1.  Ensure all tests pass.
2.  Update `ROADMAP.md` if you are completing a milestone.
3.  Describe your changes in the context of "How does this save the founder time?"
